# OpenCV Expirements

## 1. Grayscale to RGB Image Colorization

This project aims to convert grayscale images to RGB using a deep learning model.

### Directory Structure

- `data/`: Contains the COCO dataset and processed images.
- `models/`: Defines the neural network architecture.
- `scripts/`: Contains scripts for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and inference.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and custom data loaders.
- `outputs/`: Directory for saving models, logs, and results.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r GRAY_SCL_TO_RGB/requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

### Data Preprocessing

```sh
python scripts/preprocess.py
